## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Internet connection (for Google Books API)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bookfinder-ai.git
   cd bookfinder-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   - The app will automatically open at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. **Intelligent Query Generation**
When you search for "data science", the AI generates multiple strategic queries:
- `data science`
- `machine learning`
- `python data analysis` 
- `statistics programming`
- `artificial intelligence practical`

### 2. **Parallel Real-Time Search**
- Multiple Google Books API calls run simultaneously
- 15-25 books fetched per query
- Results combined and deduplicated

### 3. **Smart Ranking Algorithm**
Books are scored based on:
- **Relevance** (keyword matching, semantic similarity)
- **Quality** (rating, review count, metadata completeness)
- **User Preferences** (mood, themes, recent reads)
- **Freshness** (publication date, trending topics)

### 4. **Personalized Results**
The AI considers:
- Your emotional state and reading goals
- Books you've read recently (to avoid duplicates)
- Preferred genres and categories
- Reading difficulty and page length preferences

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Learning Data Science
**Input:** "I want to learn data science with Python for my career"

**AI Analysis:**
- Detects: Learning intent, career focus, technical subject
- Generates: data science, python programming, machine learning, career guides
- Results: Practical data science books, Python tutorials, career advice

### Example 2: Mood-Based Reading
**Input:** "I'm feeling stressed and need something uplifting and inspiring"

**AI Analysis:**
- Detects: Emotional state, mood preference
- Generates: inspiring fiction, self-help, motivational, uplifting stories
- Results: Feel-good books, inspirational biographies, stress-relief guides

### Example 3: Specific Learning Goal
**Input:** "I need advanced machine learning books for my PhD research"

**AI Analysis:**
- Detects: Advanced level, academic context, specific field
- Generates: advanced machine learning, research methods, PhD level, academic
- Results: Graduate-level textbooks, research papers, advanced algorithms

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Core Components
